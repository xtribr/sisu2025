## Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Next.js project.

### What was implemented:

1. **Installed @vercel/analytics package**
   - Added `@vercel/analytics` (v1.6.1) to project dependencies
   - Updated package-lock.json with new dependency and its transitive dependencies

2. **Added Analytics to App Router layout**
   - Imported `Analytics` from `@vercel/analytics/next` in `web/app/layout.tsx`
   - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag after `<ScoreProvider>{children}</ScoreProvider>`
   - This ensures analytics tracking is enabled for the entire application

### Files modified:
- `web/package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- `web/package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependencies
- `web/app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component

### Implementation details:
- The project uses the App Router pattern (confirmed by presence of `app/` directory with `layout.tsx`)
- Analytics component is correctly placed inside the body tag for proper initialization
- Build completes successfully with no errors
- All changes maintain existing code structure and preserve the ScoreProvider context

### Verification:
✓ Package installed successfully
✓ Build completed successfully (all routes compiled)
✓ No TypeScript errors introduced
✓ Layout component properly updated with Analytics component

The implementation follows Next.js best practices for integrating Vercel Web Analytics with the App Router architecture.
